# Hangers
Django database application to manage back-end functionality at a high level.  Dynamic linking of hanger objects allow for any structure to be created on the fly and manipulated without database migrations


## Ideas
- hangers should be like /admin
  - /hangers will bring you to all the Backend managment only with hangers though
- Create hanger forms for each of the hanger objects
